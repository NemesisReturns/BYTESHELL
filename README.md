BYTESHELL
We have made a standard Command Line Interface based on UNIX that currently supports the below mentioned builtin commands:

1. exit - Exits out of the BYTESHELL interfaace.
2. help - Displays the available builtin commands.
3. cd - Change the current working directory to the specified directory.
4. history - Displays all the previously used commands in order of excecution.
5. bg - Places the foreground job in the background.

It also supports all the already built-in commands and also displays error if there is any.
